                  solution: 'We demolished the exterior wall, replacing it with large sliding glass doors opening to a transformed private courtyard garden. Naturally water-resistant bamboo wall paneling created authentic tropical warmth throughout. Large format stone tiles in soft gray covered floors with proper drainage slopes. The centerpiece freestanding soaking tub positions perfectly to enjoy garden views. A spacious walk-in rain shower with pebble floor and bamboo bench provides spa luxury. We integrated abundant tropical plants including monstera, ferns, and orchids, both inside and in the adjacent courtyard. Natural stone vessel sinks, teak accents, and hand-crafted brass fixtures completed the zen aesthetic.',
